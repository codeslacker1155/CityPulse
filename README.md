# Google Dorker Scraper

## Description
The Google Dorker Scraper is a Python-based tool designed for extracting valuable information like names, emails, phone numbers, and social media profile links using Google search. This program leverages Google's search capabilities to locate and compile data that can be crucial for various research and marketing purposes.

## Features
- **Google Dorking**: Utilizes advanced Google search techniques to find specific data.
- **Data Extraction**: Gathers names, emails, phone numbers, and social media links.
- **Customizable Searches**: Includes options for various search terms and patterns.
- **User-Agent Rotation**: Employs different user-agents to mimic real-world browsing and avoid detection.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `bs4` (BeautifulSoup)

## Installation
To get started with the Google Dorker Scraper, clone this repository and install the necessary Python libraries.

```bash
git clone [repository-link]
cd google-dorker-scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script with Python:

```bash
python scraper-dorker.py
```

## Configuration
- **API_KEY**: Set your Google API key here.
- **EMAIL_REGEX, PHONE_REGEX, NAME_REGEX, LOCATION_REGEX**: Define regular expressions for the data you want to scrape.
- **EMAIL_LIST, SITE_LIST, SEARCH_LIST, NAME_LIST, LOCATION_LIST**: Add more search terms and patterns according to your needs.

## Disclaimer
This tool is for educational and research purposes only. Please ensure compliance with Google's terms of service and respect privacy and legal regulations when scraping data.

## Possible Improvements
- **Proxy Integration**: Implementing proxy rotation to reduce the risk of IP blacklisting.
- **Asynchronous Requests**: To speed up the scraping process.
- **GUI Implementation**: For ease of use, especially for non-technical users.
- **Data Cleaning and Validation**: To improve the quality of extracted data.
- **Database Integration**: For better data management and storage.

Regarding possible improvements for the code, here are a few suggestions:

1. **Proxy Integration**: Using proxies can help avoid IP bans or rate limits imposed by Google due to frequent requests.

2. **Asynchronous Requests**: Implementing asynchronous HTTP requests would speed up the scraping process, especially when dealing with multiple search queries.

3. **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: A simple GUI can make the tool more user-friendly, especially for those who are not comfortable with command-line interfaces.

4. **Data Cleaning and Validation**: After scraping, implementing a mechanism to clean and validate the data would be beneficial to ensure accuracy and usefulness.

5. **Database Integration**: Storing the scraped data in a database would facilitate better data management and retrieval.

6. **Expand Search Capabilities**: Incorporating more complex Google Dork queries can yield more specific and valuable results.

7. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Implementing these can help mimic human-like access patterns, reducing the risk of being detected as a scraper.

8. **Compliance Features**: Adding features to ensure compliance with legal standards and privacy regulations, such as GDPR, can be important for users scraping data from regions with strict data protection laws.

These improvements could greatly enhance the functionality and user experience of your Google Dorker Scraper.
